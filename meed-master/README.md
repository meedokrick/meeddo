Modern JS library for getting Medium RSS feeds (user, publcation, topic, or tag)
as JSON. Targets modern browsers / Node.js with an API that utilizes
[`fetch`][fetch] along with [`async` / `await`][async].

Check out the [Meed docs][docs] for details.

## What

Get Medium RSS feeds as JSON. Check out [Ghosts/medium-feed][mf] because it may
suit your needs better.

## Why

Because [@Ghosts](https://github.com/Ghosts) was writing [medium-feed][mf]. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## How

Medium provides basic docs regarding the RSS feeds: https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-RSS-feeds
You can get feeds for a user, publication, topic, or tag. Topics can be found at
https://medium.com/topics or via `Meed#topics()`. In general, feeds seem to be
limited to 10 items.

Check out the [Meed docs][docs] for more.

### Install

Via npm or unpkg:
- `npm install meed` / `yarn add meed`
- https://unpkg.com/meed

### Use

In a browser that supports [`fetch`][ciu-fetch] & [`async`/`await`][ciu-async]:

```js
const feed = new Meed()

;(async () => {
  const user = await feed.user("Medium")
  console.log(user)
})()
```

or in Node.js (bring your own `fetch`):

```js
const Meed  = require("meed")
const fetch = require("node-fetch")

const feed = new Meed({ fetch })

;(async () => {
  const user = await feed.user("Medium")
  console.log(user)
})()
```

### Proxy

For local(host) testing in a browser, you'll probably need a CORS proxy. Here's
a list: https://gist.github.com/jimmywarting/ac1be6ea0297c16c477e17f8fbe51347

You can use one like so:

```js
new Meed({ proxy: "PROXY_URL" })
```

I've had good luck with ~~https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/~~ https://cors.bridged.cc/.
